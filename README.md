## **Git Note / Tip for Your Project**

- **Repository Name:** `local-portfolio`

If you want, I can also **make a pre-written GitHub-friendly note inside VS Code** that explains all the sections and placeholders for someone visiting your repo. This makes your repo look professional and ready for users.  

Do you want me to do that?
